Api-compose documentation
=======================================

Api-compose is a Jinja-template based, configuration-first framework for orchestrating, asserting and reporting on API Calls.
All that users have to do is to declare API calls as manifest files and then submit them to the framework for execution via the CLI tool `acp`.
The framework is inspired by Kubernetes, Dbt and Cucumber (gherkin).
